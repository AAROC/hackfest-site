##  Background

Since the scope of the hackfest is very wide, it is impossible to provide a definitive list of prerequisite knowledge which will satisfy all cases. The hackfest is  **not a training event** - we are coming together to **work** intensively for a few days, in order to get ideas to a workable state and push projects out to the world. This requires that we all come prepared and take a bit of time to brush up on some skills. We provide a few suggestions for self-paced courses, and self-assessment guides in each section.

Ensure that you go through the course checklist before these course prerequisites.

## Collaborating with Code

Open Science has a strong emphasis on transparency and openness, and this includes both the _products_ and the _process_ of scientific collaboration. Central to this paradigm is the ability to easily share and review code, projects and services. We'll be using <span class="devicons devicons devicons-git" style="font-size: 1.25em; vertical-align: center;"></span> git and <i class="fa fa-github"></i> Githu to ensure change control and collaborate effectively.
