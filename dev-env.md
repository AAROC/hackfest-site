The **development environment** refers to a setup where all of the dependencies and configuration needed to both **develop** and **test** your applicaiton are available. The development environment should be as close as possible to the **deployment** environment. The tools described here are the **bare minimum** needed to complete the warmup exercises.

<li>
  <strong>{{ tool.name }}</strong>
</li>

</ul>
