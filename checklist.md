## Warm up

In order to participate in the hackfest, you will need to do some preliminary tasks. These are basic things which you likely already have, and will need later in order to collaborate and continue to contibute to both your own project and the wider community.

## On your marks

 These may include completing some of the short prerequisite courses that we think are necessary to work on the projecs, as well as to ensure that we have a common grounding. The preequisites are _elective_, so if you think you already have the skills that these courses provide, feel free to skip them.
